# HumanRecognition

## Overview
HumanRecognition is a module within the Multi-CCTV Human Behavior Analysis project. It focuses on recognizing and identifying human subjects from CCTV footage using state-of-the-art computer vision techniques.

## Features
- Detects and recognizes human figures in CCTV video streams.
- Utilizes deep learning models for accurate recognition.
- Supports multiple camera feeds.
- Modular design for easy integration and extension.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Multi-CCTV-Human-Behavior-Analysis/HumanRecognition.git
   cd HumanRecognition
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   (List dependencies here, e.g., Python, OpenCV, PyTorch, etc.)
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare your CCTV video input(s).**
2. **Run the main recognition script:**
   ```bash
   python main.py --input path/to/video.mp4
   ```

   (Add details or options as needed.)
